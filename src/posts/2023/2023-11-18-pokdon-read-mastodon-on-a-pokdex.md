Today, I attended a casual no-official-name hackathon. Just a bunch of people working on silly projects. It _did_ have a theme though: silly interfaces. I spent the first hour before I arrived thinking of a few ideas until I thought of the perfect thing: a Mastodon client but it's in a Pokédex.

[Try it out here](https://pokedon.rknight.me).

![Pokédon interface](https://rknightuk.s3.amazonaws.com/site/pokedon.png)

It's fairly limited but you can:

- Sign into your instance
- View your timeline
- Navigate with the keyboard (up/down for newer/older toots)
- Listen to a toot with the [SpeechSynthesis API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis)

Things it doesn't do right now:

- Be responsive. I just didn't have time today.
- Allow boosting and favouriting.
- Allow you to pause audio.
- View followers
- View your activity

I will probably come back to this at some point and add some of these features but as it is I'm pretty happy with this as a day's project.
