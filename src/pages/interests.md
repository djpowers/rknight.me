### Web

I love the web. [It's fantastic](https://rknight.me/blog/the-web-is-fantastic/). I want everyone to have a website, or a way to post things, away from the corporate bullshit of Facebook, Twitter, and the rest. I try to [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) my stuff as much as possible.

I love small websites. Single purpose sites that do one thing really well. 

I love reading people's personal websites. I'm always interested in seeing how people structure their notes, blog posts, and other _stuff_ they want to have on their website.

I generally build [my projects](/projects) with PHP and Laravel if I need a backend[^1] or Eleventy for everything else. See my [/uses page](/uses) for more on this.

### Music

The genre I listen to most is pop punk, mostly from 20 years ago. Basically a Tony Hawk game soundtrack that never ends. I also enjoy a lot of west coast rap, rock, and pop - the pop has to be banging though. You can see my listening history [on Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/rknightuk).

### Movies

I don't have as much time to watch movies like I did before Baby Knight was born but when I do I want something fun. The genre doesn't matter and honesly quality doesn't matter, I just want to be entertained. I have [a podcast about the Fast and Furious saga](https://wegot.family) to give you some indication of my tastes.

### TV

I am more selective with TV and aside from rewatching Scrubs, Friends, and Grey's Anatomy every now and again, I tend to go for shorter series from streaming services like The Last of Us, Jack Reacher, and Severance.

### Games

I have [a fairly large physical game and console collection](/collections/games). I love owning the physical version of a game even if it is less convinient than digital.

[This post gives a more detailed overview of the games I like](https:/rknight.me/blog/my-favourite-games/) but in general I stick to a couple of genres:

- Third-person story-driven games like Uncharted, The Last of Us, and Horizon
- 3D platformers like Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter, Sackboy
- Racing games like Mario Kart and Hot Wheels
- Skateboarding games, specifically the Tony Hawk series

I can't play FPS games - I end up feeling sick.

### Pizza

I love all kinds of pizza but especially fresh pizza made in my Ooni oven. Each year [my recipes](https://rknight.me/blog/one-year-of-pizza-making/) taste better and better. 

### Other Interests

These are things I enjoy but not enough to put substantial time, or money, into.

- Carpentry. I really enjoyed building my own desk but I don't have the time or space to start furniture making as a hobby.
- Fonts. I love fonts and I would love to make my own one day.
- Mechanical keyboards. This is a relatively new discovery but I really like using my [8BitDo Keyboard](https://rknight.me/blog/using-the-8bitdo-keyboard-on-macos/). I'm using all my willpower to not buy more keyboards and [beautiful keycaps](https://drop.com/buy/drop-bees-keys-gmk-zx-keycap-set?defaultSelectionIds=985577#signupv2).
- Design. I'm fascinated by how talented some people are when it comes to design be that products, app icons, or websites.
