I'm not going to list everything I use but here's some of the really useful apps I use:

- [Gitify](https://github.com/manosim/gitify) - GitHub notifications in the menu bar
- [Bumpr](https://getbumpr.com) - Choose a browser to open links with. Very useful if you use multiple browsers regularly
- [Amphetamine](https://roaringapps.com/app/amphetamine) - Keep your Mac awake
- [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com) - Database management app
- [StopTheNews](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/StopTheNews.html) - Make Apple News links open in Safari on the Mac
