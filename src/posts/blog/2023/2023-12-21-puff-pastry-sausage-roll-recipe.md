Here is the recipe for very easy to make sausage rolls. You'll need:

- ~450g of sausage meat. I prefer to buy sausages and remove the skin as there's a bigger variety of flavours available without having to add stuff to sausage meat myself
- A sheet of puff pastry. In the UK at least these come in a standard size of 320g ([example](https://groceries.asda.com/product/pastry-dough/jus-rol-puff-pastry-ready-rolled-sheet/910000468752))
- An egg
- A baking tray and some greaseproof/baking paper

Preheat the oven to 180Â°c. Whisk up an egg in a bowl.

Lay the puff pastry flat and lay a cylinder of sausage meat about an inch thick across the pastry. Roll the pastry around that and cut it so there's just enough to cover the meat with a little bit of overlap. Do this until you run out of pastry. 

Grab your baking tray, lay down some greaseproof paper on it, then brush the tray with the eggwash. 

Cut up your long sausage roll into inch-wide smaller sausage rolls and pop them on the baking tray, seam down. Brush them with egg and pop them in the oven for 20-25 minutes until they're golden brown all over.

Boom. Sausage rolls for days.
