I tried this recipe on boxing day this year and it was fantastic so we made some more tonight which were, unsurprisingly, also fantastic. 

You will need:

- Maris Piper potatoes. 2kg is a reasonable amount for 4-6 people but we ate all those between three of us so do as many as you ~~want~~ can fit in your oven
- Goose fat
- Olive oil (optional)
- Salt
- Garlic
- Fresh rosemary
- Fresh thyme

Peel the potatoes and chop them into four (or more if you have exceptionally large potatoes). Give them a rinse to remove some of the starch. Pre-heat the oven to 180Â°c.

Boil them in water with salt, crushed garlic, and a bit of rosemary and thyme for 15-20 minutes until they _just_ start become soft. Drain them and leave them to dry for about 10 minutes.

While the potatoes are draining, pop a generous amount of goose fat (I use somewhere around 100g) in a roasting tray, along with a drizzle of olive oil if you're feeling fancy, and stick it in the oven to get the fat nice and hot.

After the potatoes have dried out and the goose fat is hot, put all the potatoes in the roasting tray and make sure they all get a good covering with the fat, then into the oven with them. All told these should cook for around 90 minutes. Every 30 minutes take them out and turn them to make sure they're cooking evenly. For the last 20 minutes, sprinkle some salt on them, and pop some garlic cloves, rosemary, and thyme into the tray. Serve them up and eat all the potatoes you can.

This recipe came from a Facebook reel which I'm not linking to for two reasons:

1. I had to OCR the steps out of the comments on the video so I worked hard for this
2. I can't find it anymore because searching for reels is impossible
3. Who puts a recipe in a video comment, come on
