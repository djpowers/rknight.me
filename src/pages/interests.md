### Web

I love the web. [It's fantastic](https://rknight.me/blog/the-web-is-fantastic/). I want everyone to have a website, or a way to post things, away from the corporate bullshit of Facebook, Twitter, and the rest. I try to [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) my stuff as much as possible.

I'm fascinated by decentralised services like Mastodon and open protocols like ActivityPub and the way they're opening up interesting use cases for social media, podcasting, and other things that previously have been locked into one closed service.

I love small websites. Single purpose sites that do one thing really well. 

I love reading people's personal websites. I'm always interested in seeing how people structure their notes, blog posts, and other _stuff_ they want to have on their website.

I generally build [my projects](/projects) with PHP and Laravel if I need a backend[^1] or Eleventy for everything else. See the [colophon](/about/colophon) for more on how this site is built.

### Music

The genre I listen to most is pop punk, mostly from 20 years ago. Basically a Tony Hawk game soundtrack that never ends. I also enjoy a lot of rap, rock, and pop - the pop has to be banging though. You can see my listening history [on Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/rknightuk).

### Movies

I don't have as much time to watch movies as I did before Baby Knight was born but when I do I want something fun. The genre doesn't matter and quite frankly quality doesn't matter, I just want to be entertained. I have [a podcast about the Fast and Furious saga](https://wegot.family) to give you some indication of my tastes.

### TV

I am more selective with TV so aside from rewatching Scrubs, Friends, and Grey's Anatomy every now and again, I tend to go for shorter series like The Last of Us and Severance. "Prestige TV" they call this, which is a silly name for it.

### Games

I have [a fairly large physical game and console collection](/collections/games). I love owning the physical version of a game even if it is less convinient than digital.

[This post gives a more detailed overview of the games I like](https:/rknight.me/blog/my-favourite-games/) but in general I stick to a couple of genres:

- Third-person story-driven games like Uncharted, The Last of Us, and Horizon
- 3D platformers like Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter, Sackboy
- Racing games like Mario Kart and Hot Wheels
- Skateboarding games, specifically the Tony Hawk series

I can't play FPS games - I end up feeling sick.

### Pizza

I love all kinds of pizza but especially fresh pizza made in my Ooni oven. Each year [my recipes](https://rknight.me/blog/one-year-of-pizza-making/) taste better and better. 

### Other Interests

These are things I enjoy but not enough to put substantial time, or money, into.

- Carpentry. I really enjoyed building my own desk but I don't have the time or space to start furniture making as a hobby.
- Fonts. I love fonts and I would love to make my own one day.
- Mechanical keyboards. This is a relatively new discovery but I really like using my [8BitDo Keyboard](https://rknight.me/blog/using-the-8bitdo-keyboard-on-macos/). I'm using all my willpower to not buy more keyboards and [beautiful keycaps](https://drop.com/buy/drop-bees-keys-gmk-zx-keycap-set?defaultSelectionIds=985577#signupv2).
- Design. I'm fascinated by how talented some people are when it comes to design be that products, app icons, or websites.
