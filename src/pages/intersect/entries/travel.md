Chain hotels are more consistent than independent ones, so I usually go for them.

Never change planes to save a bit of money on a long flight, it's not worth it.

Avoid the M25 at all costs.

### Travel Gear

Get one of [these chargers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anker-5-Port-Charger-PowerPort-Samsung-Blue/dp/B01KUTRGS4) (or similar) and some extra cables. Then you only have to plug one thing in at the place you're staying.

### Places

#### New York

- Book all your tickets in advance and avoid the "bundle of ticket" places if you can afford to. The bundle tickets (usually) are a voucher you have to exchange for a ticket when you get there and some places (like Ellis Island/Statue of Liberty) can have multiple-hour queues.
- Get a hotel as close as you can to a subway station. New York is lot of walking and it's always start/stop so being close to a station is a god send at the end of a long day.
- The [Roosevelt Tramway](https://rioc.ny.gov/302/Tram) is fun (and you can use your subway pass for it)

#### Las Vegas

- Try to get a hotel in the middle of the strip, somewhere around [The Bellagio](https://bellagio.mgmresorts.com/en.html). Makes it a lot easier to get around
- Book in advance for day trips like the Grand Canyon, on-the-day prices are really expensive
- There's a [monorail](https://www.lvmonorail.com/)

#### UK

These are the AirBNBs I've been to that I would recommend. I've linked to other websites where I can because AirBNBs fees are insane.

- [Malvern Hills Lodge](https://www.visitthemalverns.org/accommodation/malvern-hills-lodge/) - This place is incredible. Pricey, but worth it.
- [The Hide Away, Powys, Wales](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/15130066)
- [Ashlea Lakeside Retreat](https://www.ashlealakesideretreat.co.uk/) - (relatively) cheap place to getaway for a few days.

###### Windmill Retreat, Edlesborough

[Windmill Retreat, Edlesborough](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/18494069) deserves it's own section. From my review on AirBNB:

> We broke down about 10 miles away on our way to the windmill, the car battery was dead. We were able to get it to a local garage after the breakdown people arrived and then we walked the mile to the windmill - this was 8pm-ish so the garage was closed.

The next day Lizzie, the host, dealt with everything: called the garage, dropped the keys off to them, gave us a lift to the zoo, then called us when the car was fixed and ready to pick up.

##### Zoos

We generally visit at least one zoo every year. These are my favourites:

- [Cotswold Wildlife Park and Gardens](https://www.cotswoldwildlifepark.co.uk/) - This has a great layout, allows dogs, and a lot of the enclosures are way more "open" than some other zoos. You can stand right next to the penguins and (theoretically) touch them.
- [Paradise Wildlife Park](https://www.pwpark.com/) - Feeding the Lemurs here was amazing.
- [ZSL London Zoo](https://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo) - Really great, much better than it's other site at [Whipsnade](https://www.zsl.org/zsl-whipsnade-zoo) which feels kind of empty.
