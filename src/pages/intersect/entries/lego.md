I have [quite a lot of Lego](https://brickset.com/sets/ownedby-rknightuk) although I've sold a bunch of it the last few years to keep only the larger display sets like [The Mustang](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/ford-mustang-10265).

### Tracking Lego Sets

[Brickset](https://brickset.com) is the best way to keep track of which sets and minifigures you own, as well as sets you want. It also has stats on values and number of peices. I [wrote a blog post about it](https://rknight.me/manage-your-lego-collection-with-brickset/).

[Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com) also has collection tracking but I haven't used it.

### Buying Lego

Direct from [Lego](https://lego.com) is the best place to get sets as soon as they get released but [Amazon](https://amazon.co.uk), [Smyths](https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb), and [Argos](https://argos.co.uk) are all pretty good for buying at decent prices albeit later than release date usually. For second-hand or hard-to-find sets [eBay](https://ebay.co.uk) or [Bricklink](https://bricklink.com) is your best bet.

#### Bricklink

[Bricklink](https://bricklink.com) is now owned by Lego, but it still works as it did before the purchase.

Bricklink is a marketplace of sellers rather than a single store, so you have to find a seller that has everything you want, or find multiple sellers. Shipping can get expensive but Bricklink has tools to find to most efficient way to purchase a list of peices.
