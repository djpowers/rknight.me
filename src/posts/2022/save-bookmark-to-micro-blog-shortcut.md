I recently signed up (again) to [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) in an attempt to move away from services run by [billionare shitposters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk). I will probably write up a full post about it soon but you can hear me talk about it on [episode 144 of Ruminate](https://ruminatepodcast.com/episodes/144) or [view my micro blog here](https://toot.rknight.me).

One of the features Micro.blog offers is bookmarking of posts and links. After a [conversation about using micro.blog as a read later service](https://micro.blog/rknightuk/12770616) and finding the correct API I put together shortcuts to save bookmarks on iOS and MacOS. You'll need to get an access token from [the apps settings page](https://micro.blog/account/apps).

### MacOS

MacOS shortcuts lacks support for using the sharesheet without a [third-party app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sharebot-for-shortcuts/id1597340986?mt=12) so instead you can run this shortcut whenever and it gets the current Safari page URL.

### iOS

The iOS version shows up in the share sheet so it can be used wherever you share links.

If there's a way to combine these so one shortcut works for both MacOS and iOS, I'd love to hear it.
